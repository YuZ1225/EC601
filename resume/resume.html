            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>As a bronze medal winner in Chinese Mathematical Olympiad, my passion and persistence in studying electrical engineering puzzle the people around me. They often ask why I am so motivated to pursue a career in this field instead of Mathematics. They don’t know how much fun I have in it. 
                </p>

As a child, I had always been fascinated by electronic devices “listening” to human commands and performing accordingly. It looked like magic to me and I desired to know the scene behind it. In college, I made my own decision to major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. It is really my honor to get accepted into UM-SJTU Joint Institute (established by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of Michigan, and all courses are taught in English by world-class faculty), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, ranking top 10 in China. It was in my first year of university that this miraculous world that I had always been trying to explore began to open its door for me.

As written in CV, I carried out two projects in my freshman year: to design and build a floating hovercraft for racing and an unmanned searching quadcopter for rescuing purposes. As a starter, I did encounter many difficulties trying to get the work done. For example, I had zero experience in mechanical design or processing at that point, not even to mention making three-view drawings with AutoCAD. Also, I had to learn fluid mechanics by myself to make more reasonable configurational designs. Due to my innovative hard work, the Bluetooth controlled hovercraft I made got the 1st place in a racing contest out of 17 teams. This honor could serve as recognition of the many hours I spent in the library searching literatures and the long nights working in the laboratory. More importantly, I came to know my own potential: I have enough courage to confront difficulties and also have the capacity to quickly learn new stuff by myself. I believe this characteristic could benefit my future study and work.
